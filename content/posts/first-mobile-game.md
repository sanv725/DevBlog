I'm gonna try and create my first mobile game. Will be using Buildbox because I had already purchased it so I'll try to get some value out of it.
My goal would be to just publish to the Google Play Store because of easier submission process than compared to the Apple App Store.
My stretch goal would be to earn **$1/month** with this game.

This first game will be a space shooter. There is already a Buildbox template for this, so I'm gonna try and learn how Buildbox works with this first game and add simple mechanics such as shooting bullets, health, and enemies.

Before submission, I'll try to have at least 5 different levels for the scenes, with 2 easy, 2 medium and 1 hard.

Temporary name for the game right now: **Adventures of S - Space Shooter Edition**.

Thinking about possibly using the same name for all games that I do and just change the type of game for the edition.
